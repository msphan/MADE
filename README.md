# MADE

**Distance measure between two tomographic projections with unknown directions**

This project includes implementation of MADE, which is a distance measure between two tomographic projections taken at unknown angles.
MADE can be used instead of the Euclidean distance to improve the reconstruction resolution. An application of MADE can be found in folder
*SphericalMADEReconst*.
